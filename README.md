# 📊 SQL Portfolio: Data Engineering & Analytics

Welcome to my SQL portfolio. This repository is a collection of end-to-end projects demonstrating my ability to transform raw, messy data into actionable business intelligence using advanced SQL techniques.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 1. [Tech Industry Layoffs Analysis](./01_Tech_Layoffs_Analysis/)
**Focus:** Data Cleaning (ETL), Pipeline Engineering, and Exploratory Data Analysis.
* **Problem:** Raw layoff data was inconsistent, duplicated, and contained missing values.
* **Solution:** Built a multi-stage cleaning pipeline in MySQL using CTEs and Window Functions to ensure 100% data integrity.
* **Key Result:** Identified a 15% volatility spike in the Retail sector and tracked impact across 380k+ global employees.
* **Tech:** MySQL, Self-Joins, Rolling Averages, Indexing.

## 🛠️ Technical Toolkit
* **Dialects:** MySQL (Expert), PostgreSQL (Intermediate)
* **Concepts:** CTEs, Window Functions (Rank, Row_Number, Lead/Lag), Staging Tables, Schema Design, Performance Tuning (Indexing).
* **Tools:** DBeaver, MySQL Workbench, Git.

## 📈 Database Architecture Methodology
I follow a systematic approach to every SQL project to ensure scalability and accuracy:



1. **Staging:** Importing raw data into a safe environment.
2. **Cleaning:** Removing duplicates and standardizing formats.
3. **Imputation:** Handling null values through logical joins.
4. **Analysis:** Developing KPIs and trend reports for stakeholders.
